# Report 6 - Week of 10/02/2023

## Progress & Reflections & Speculations
This week, we completed the design brief and specifications. Our project is called Meditation Bloom. It aims to amalgamate technology, aesthetic, and mindfulness, crafting a transformative physical and mental experience. It is a meditation-assistive device that provides a multi-sensory experience by integrating visual, tactile, and audial cues, thus enhancing the user's focus and immersion during the meditation process. We figured out the what we want to make and roughly how we are going to make them.
